You could make it let you walk through blocks with gaps (fences, doors, iron bars, etc). Possibly let you fly when using it since its so expensive and far down the tree. Could literally be a batmode upgrade. Possibly make the player have resistance while doing it or just flat invincible since they're a mist that cannot be hit (I imagine holy water or other magical/anti-vampire attacks would still hit the vampire, maybe even force them out of mist form). Also make it so the particles arent visible in first person so they dont cover the screen. Could also do some kinda ability to expand the mist outward as to hide yourself. Would have some fun counter play with hunters using holy water or crucifixes or garlic diffusers do force you out. Can't think of anything for werewolves countering it though.
